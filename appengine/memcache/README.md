> The Memcache service is currently not available for the App Engine flexible environment.
> An alpha version of the memcache service will be available shortly. If you would like to be
> notified when the service is available, fill out this
> [early access form](https://goo.gl/forms/kklwZTrkicAKaHrD3).
